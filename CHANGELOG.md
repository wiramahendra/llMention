## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Release Summary
This is the first public release candidate for LLMention v0.3.0, featuring a completely normalized CLI with clean command names and an evidence-based workflow. The CLI has been stabilized with production-ready commands for project initialization, prompt discovery, multi-sample auditing, report generation, and content gap analysis.

### Changed
- Promoted v0.2 evidence engine workflow to primary CLI commands
- `init2` → `init`: Initialize project with llmention.toml
- `prompts2 discover/list` → `prompts discover/list`: Prompt management
- `audit2 run/list/show` → `audit run/list/show`: Evidence-based audits
- `report2` → `report`: Generate markdown reports from audit results
- `generate2` → `generate`: Generate content assets from audit gaps
- `diagnose2` → `diagnose`: URL crawlability diagnostics
- `compare` → `audit compare`: Compare two audit runs
- Renamed legacy commands to `audit-legacy`, `report-legacy`, `generate-legacy`

### Deprecated
- Temporary `*2` command names are deprecated but still work with warnings
- Legacy domain-based workflow is preserved as `*-legacy` commands

### Added
- Project-level configuration via `llmention.toml`
- Multi-sample audits with statistical significance
- Raw evidence storage for transparency
- Prompt categorization with intent and funnel stage
- Content gap analysis from audit results
- Before/after audit comparison
- Mock provider for testing without API keys
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/v0.2-evidence-engine-guide.md`
- Release validation script at `scripts/validate-release.sh`

### Known Limitations
- **AI visibility results are probabilistic**: Scores represent likelihood based on configured prompts and samples, not guarantees of future model behavior
- **Results depend on prompt sets**: Visibility scores are only as comprehensive as your configured prompt sets
- **Real improvement takes time**: Publishing content is step one; model retraining and indexing happens on varying schedules (days to months)
- **Citation behavior varies significantly**: Different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) exhibit different citation patterns
- **Mock provider is for testing only**: The mock provider validates workflows but does not measure actual visibility
- **Cloud provider warnings**: Commands using real providers should warn that prompts will be sent to external APIs

### Migration Notes
If you were using the temporary `*2` commands from v0.2.x:
- `init2` → `init`
- `prompts2` → `prompts`
- `audit2` → `audit run`
- `report2` → `report`
- `generate2` → `generate`
- `diagnose2` → `diagnose`

The old `*2` commands will continue to work with a deprecation warning.
